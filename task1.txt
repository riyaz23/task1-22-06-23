2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
3.codekata practice
4.Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address


Solution
1. HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

2.object in js

allows you to store multiple collections of data.
object is a key: value pair separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces {}.

const person = {
  fname:" John",
  lname:" Doe",
  age: 25
};

mac MAC address is a six-byte hexadecimal address, whereas an IP address is either a four- or sixteen-byte address. Both the MAC and IP Address assist in uniquely defining a device on the internet. The Network Interface Controller (NIC) Cardâ€™s Manufacturer provides the MAC Address, while the Internet Service Provider(ISP) provides IP Address.
